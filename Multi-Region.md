### 🌍 Download Speed Comparison by Region

This chart compares download speeds (in Mbps) across five test iterations from:

- **US**: speedtest.tele2.net (10MB.zip)
- **Europe**: speed.hetzner.de (10MB.bin)
- **Asia**: sgp-ping.vultr.com (10MB.bin)

Each line represents a region’s performance over time:

### 📈 Simulated Results

| Iteration | US (Mbps) | Europe (Mbps) | Asia (Mbps) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1         | 12.5      | 18.1           | 9.4         |
| 2         | 13.2      | 17.8           | 9.6         |
| 3         | 12.8      | 18.5           | 9.2         |
| 4         | 13.0      | 18.2           | 9.5         |
| 5         | 12.9      | 18.0           | 9.3         |

Europe consistently outperforms the other regions in this simulation, while Asia shows slightly lower throughput—likely due to longer round-trip latency or peering differences.
